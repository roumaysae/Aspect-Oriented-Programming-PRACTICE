# Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) Practice

## Overview
This project demonstrates practical implementations of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) concepts using two approaches:

1. **AspectJ AOP** - Standalone implementation showcasing the principles and usage of AspectJ for modularizing cross-cutting concerns.
2. **Spring AOP** - Integration with the Spring framework to achieve separation of concerns in a real-world Java application.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`.idea/`**: Project configuration files for the IDE.
- **`AspectJ-AOP/`**: Contains the implementation of AOP using AspectJ. This folder demonstrates how AspectJ can be used to define and apply aspects.
- **`spring-aop/`**: Contains the implementation of AOP using Spring Framework. It shows how Spring manages aspects and integrates them into the application context.

## Requirements
To run the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java 8 or higher**
- **Maven** for dependency management
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (optional but recommended)

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/roumaysae/Aspect-Oriented-Programming-PRACTICE.git
```

### Running the Project
#### AspectJ AOP
1. Navigate to the `AspectJ-AOP` directory.
2. Use your IDE to import the project.
3. Compile and run the code to see AspectJ AOP in action.

#### Spring AOP
1. Navigate to the `spring-aop` directory.
2. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
3. Run the Spring application to see AOP functionalities implemented via Spring.

## Key Features

- **AspectJ Implementation**:
  - Standalone demonstration of aspects, join points, and advice types.
- **Spring AOP Implementation**:
  - Real-world scenarios showcasing Spring's capabilities for handling cross-cutting concerns.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the core concepts of AOP: Aspect, Join Point, Advice, Pointcut.
- Gain hands-on experience with AspectJ and Spring AOP.
- Learn how to modularize cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transaction management.
